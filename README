This is dopewars 1.5.5, a game simulating the life of a drug dealer in 
New York. The aim of the game is to make lots and lots of money...
unfortunately, you start the game with a hefty debt, accumulating interest,
and the cops take a rather dim view of drug dealing...

These are brief instructions; see the HTML documentation for full information.

dopewars 1.5.5 servers should handle clients as old as version 1.4.3 with
hardly any visible problems (the reverse is also true). However, it is
recommended that both clients and servers are upgraded to 1.5.5!

INSTALLATION

Either...

1. Get the relevant RPM from http://dopewars.sourceforge.net/
   
Or...

2. Get the tarball dopewars-1.5.5.tar.gz from the same URL
   Extract it via. tar -xvzf dopewars-1.5.5.tar.gz
   Follow the instructions in the INSTALL file in the newly-created
      dopewars-1.5.5 directory

Once you're done, you can safely delete the RPM, tarball and dopewars
directory. The dopewars binary is all you need!

dopewars stores its high score files by default in /usr/share/dopewars.sco
This will be created by make install or by RPM installation. A different high 
score file can be selected with the -f switch.

WIN32 INSTALLATION

dopewars now compiles as a console or regular application under Win32
(Windows 95, 98, NT, 2000, XP). Almost all functionality of the standard Unix
binary is retained; for example, all of the same command line switches are
supported. However, for convenience, the configuration file is the more
Windows-friendly "dopewars-config.txt".

The easiest way to install the Win32 version is to download the precompiled
binary. The supplied configure script, however, should build the binary
correctly under Cygwin (see the INSTALL file for details).

USAGE

dopewars has built-in client-server support for multi-player games. For a
full list of options configurable on the command line, run dopewars with
the -h switch.

dopewars -a
This is "antique" dopewars; it tries to keep to the original dopewars, based
on the "Drug Wars" game by John E. Dell, as closely as possible.

dopewars
By default, dopewars supports multi-player games. On starting a game, the
program will attempt to connect to a dopewars server so that players can send
messages back and forth, and shoot each other if they really want to...

dopewars -s
Starts a dopewars server. This sits in the background and handles multi-player
games. You probably want to use the -l command line option too to direct its
log output to somewhere sensible.

dopewars -c
Create and run a computer dopewars player. This will attempt to connect
to a dopewars server, and if this succeeds, it will then participate in
multi-player dopewars games.

CONFIGURATION

Most of the dopewars defaults (for example, the location of the high score file,
the port and server to connect to, the names of the drugs and guns, etc.) can be
configured by adding suitable entries to the dopewars configuration file. The
global file /etc/dopewars is read first, and can then be overridden by the local
settings in ~/.dopewars. All of the settings here can also be set on the command
line of an interactive dopewars server when no players are logged on. See the
file "example-cfg" for an example configuration file, and for a brief
explanation of each option, type "help" in an interactive server. A subset of
the configuration options can also be tweaked via. the "Options" menu item
in the GTK+/Win32 client.

PLAYING

dopewars is supposed to be fairly self-explanatory. You should be able to 
pick the basics up fairly quickly, but still be discovering subtleties for 
_ages_ ;) If you're _really_ stuck, send me an email. I might even answer it!

Clue: buy drugs when they're cheap, sell them when they're expensive. The Bronx
and Ghetto are "special" locations. Anything more would spoil the fun. ;)

BUGS

Well, there are bound to be lots. Let me know if you find any, and I'll see
if I can fix 'em... of course, a working patch would be even nicer! ;)
