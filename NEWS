     The dopewars project, previously hosted solely at
http://bellatrix.pcl.ox.ac.uk/~ben/dopewars/ now has an additional home at
SourceForge! This is to allow developers easier access to development codes
(by CVS) and to take advantage of SourceForge's mailing lists and forums.
Translators are particularly needed for translation of the development
version of the dopewars code into other languages!

2nd August 2000
    The German translation now has its home at
http://www.ideenpark.de/dopewars/. This site also mirrors the original
English version of the program.

http://www.rLUG.de/files/dopewars-german/.

number of players and high scores, to the metaserver. Several bugs, mainly
in the Win32 networking code, have been fixed.

     A mirror in the US is now available for dopewars downloads. Follow the US
links (as opposed to the UK links) on the download page to download from this
site.

proxies now.

     Snapshots of the latest in-development version of dopewars are now made
available on a semi-regular basis at the main download page. HTML documentation
is also now available.

date. Other minor changes fix small bugs from earlier versions.

15th September 1999 
     Servers can now be registered by completing the form at 
http://bellatrix.pcl.ox.ac.uk/~ben/dopewars/serverform.html. The upcoming

the completion of registration details automatically.

     dopewars 1.4.1 released. This fixes a bug with the loan shark, which was
discovered by several people quick off the mark; dunno how that slipped past my
team of beta testers here at Oxford - they're obviously too busy doing "real"
work!

     First GPL release of dopewars (1.4.0)
